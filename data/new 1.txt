STP 
the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) defines standard temperature to be 0°C [273.15°K, 32°F] and standard pressure to be 100 kPa [1 bar, 0.9869 atm, 14.504 psi] and the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE) defines standard temperature to be 15°C [288.15°K, 59°F] and standard pressure to be 100 kPa.
Pyrolysis 
A type of geochemical analysis in which a rock sample is subject to controlled heating in an inert gas to or past the point of generating hydrocarbons in order to assess its quality as a source rock, the abundance of organic material in it, its thermal maturity, and the quality of hydrocarbons it might generate or have generated. Pyrolysis breaks large hydrocarbon molecules into smaller molecules. This process is used to determine the quality of shale as a source rock and is instrumental in evaluating shale gas plays.
GIIP 
Abbreviation for gas initially in place, the volume of gas in a reservoir before production
Solution gas or dissolved gas
Gas dissolved in oil at higher pressures.The lighter the oil the more gas will typically be dissolved in it.
GOR gas oil ratio 
Is the ratio of produce gas to oil.
Solution gas - oil ratio Rs
The ratio of solution gas that is measured in scm/cubic meter.
GOR in heavy oil 
Is very low and is often an economical to capture the low pressure, low volume gas.
A gas cap will form 
And oil reservoir may contain an oil that has absorbed all the solution gas that I can take. If there is more gas present then can be absorbed by the oil, The oil is considered saturated and there will be free gas present in the gas cap above the oil.
Under-saturated oil reservoir
If all the gas is absorbed in the oil and there is no gas cap, the oil in the reservoir is considered under saturated reservoir conditions.
Crude oil with a gas cap 
Natural gas exists about the crude oil. It's later density causes it to rise and take the high points of the reservoir. Gas is also dissolved in the oil - term solution gas. The gas is released from the oil as the pressure decreases.
Under saturated crude oil-pure liquid in the reservoir
This type of reservoir is usually at fairly high pressure. All the gas in the reservoir has dissolved into the oil. When the oil is brought to the surface, the solution gas vaporizes and is separated from the oil. Under saturated reservoirs only remain under saturated until the pressure in the reservoir declines.
Dry gas reservoirs 
When the gas comes to surface no liquids are produced except water.
Wet gas 
Reservoirs are mostly methane but also contain heavy ends such a C3 and heavier. When the gas comes to surface, hydrocarbons liquefy as condensate.
PVT analysis 
Pressure- Volume - temperature
PVT analysis essentially describes
The state of the reservoir fluid when the pressure is X and the temperature is Y. - At A high pressure and low temperature, a reservoir fluid is likely to be liquid -at a low pressure and high temperature, the reservoir fluid is likely to be paper
Critical temperature TC 
Equals the critical temperature - compressed gas all you want and it's still too hot to form a liquid
Critical PC

In pulse testing, This parameter represents the total time length of a cycle, i.e., the shut-in period plus the flow or injection period.
Cycle period ΔtC
In pulse testing, This parameter represents the length of the flow or injection time.
Flowing or Injection period Δtf
In pulse testing, This parameter represents the elapsed time between the end of a pulse and the pressure peak caused by the pulse. THis is associated with each pulse and essentially describes the time required for a pulse created when the rate is changed to move from the active well to the observation well.
Time lag tL
In pulse testing, This parameter is the vertical distance between two adjacent peaks (or valleys) and a line parallel to this through the valley(or peak)
Pressure response amplitude Δp
Who proposed a pulse test analysis technique that uses the four dimensionless groups?
Kamal and Brigham(1975)

In this test the well is shut in until the pressure is stabilized at initial reservoir pressure pi. At this time, the injection begins at a constant rate qinj, while recording the bottomhole pressure pwf.
Injectivity test
This test is usually
preceded by an
injectivity test of a long
duration. This testing is
analogous to pressure
build-up testing in a
production well. Also is
concerned as the
measurement and
analysis of pressure
data taken after an
injection well is shut in.

could be induced in the
reservoir rock. In this
test, water is injected at
a constant rate for
about 30 minutes
before the rate is
increased and
maintained for
successive periods,
each of which alasts for
30 minutes. The
pressure observed at
the end of each
injection rate is plotted
versus the rate. This plot
usually shows two
straight lines which
intersect at the fracture
pressure of the
formation.
This type of drive in the
reserovir is
characterized for water
associated to one
infinite active aquifer
encroaching across the
original hydrocarbonwater contact. Name it.
Natural Water Drive
This term refers to the
water encroachment
mechanism in which the
rate of water influx
equals the reservoir
total production rate.
These drive are
typically characterized
"Active"water drive

by a gradual and slow
reservoir pressure
decline.
How can be classified
the natural water drive
based on the degree of
reservoir pressure
maintenance provided
by the aquifer?
As Active, Partial and Limited water drive
This reservoir-aquifer
system indicates that
the effect of the
pressure changes at the
oil/aquifer boundary
can never be felt at the
outer boundary.
Infinite system
This reserovir-aquifer
system indicates that
the aquifer outer limit is
affected by the influx
into the oil zone and
that the pressure at this
outer limit changes with
time.
Finite system
How can be classified
the reservoir-aquifer
systems on the basis of
flow geometry?
As edge-water drive, bottom-water drive, linear-water
drive.
In this natural water
drive, water moves into
the flanks of the
reservoir as a result of
hydrocarbon
production and
Edge-water drive

pressure drop at the
reservoir-aquifer
boundary. The flow is
essentially radial with
negligible flow in the
vertical direction.
This natural water drive
occurs in reservoirs with
large areal extent and a
gentle dip where the
reservoir-water contact
completely underlies
the reservoir. The flow is
essentially radial and, in
contrast to the edgewater drive, this water
drive drive has
significant vertical flow.
Bottom-water drive
In this water drive, the
influx is from one flank
of the reservoir. The
flow is strictly linear
with a constant cross
sectional area.

three, What are
indicating?
Mention four
mathematical water
influx models that are
commonly used in the
petroleum industry.
Fetkovich, Schilthuis, Carter-Tracy, Van Everdingen and
Hurst
This is the simplest
model that can be used
to estimate the water
influx into a gas or oil
reservoir is based on
the basic definition of
compressibility, and it's
only applicable to a
small aquifer, whose
dimensions are of the
same order of
magnitude as the
reservoir itself. Name it.
Pot Aquifer model
Who pointed out that
because the aquifer is
considered relatively
small, a pressure drop
in the reservoir is
instantaneously
transmitted throughout
the entire reservoiraquifer system?
Dake (1978)
Who proposed that for
an aquifer that is flowing

flow regime, the flow
behavior could be
described by Darcy's
equation?
In the Schilthuis steadystate model for
reservoir-aquifer
model, How is called
the parameter C and in
which units is
expressed?
"Water Influx Constant" and expressed in bbl/day/psi
Who proposed that the
"apparent"aquifer radius
ra would increase with
time and, therefore, the
dimensionless radius
ra/re may be replaced
with a time-dependent
function?
Hurst (1943)
This flowing condition is
defined as the time
period during which the
boundary has no effect
on the pressure
behavior.
Transient (unsteady-state) condition
Who solved the
diffusivity equation for
the aquifer-reservoir
system by applying the
Laplace transformation
to the equation?
Van Everdingen and Hurst (1949)
This term is defined as
the interface between
the reservoir and the
aquifer.

Who proposed a
calculation technique
that does not require
superposition and
allows direct calculation
of water influx?
Carter and Tracy (1960)
This water influx model
assumes constant water
influx rates over each
finite time interval. The
accuracy of this method
can be increased
substantially by
restricting the time step
to one month.
Carter and Tracy water influx model
This model is based on
the premise that the
productivity index
concept will adequately
describe water influx
from a finite aquifer into
a hydrocarbon
reservoir. That is, the
water influx rate is
directly proportional to
the pressure drop
between the average
aquifer pressure and
the pressure at the
reservoir-aquifer
boundary.
